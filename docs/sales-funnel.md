What is a Sales Funnel?

A sales funnel shows how customers move from discovering a brand to making a purchase. It’s called a “funnel” because many people start at the top, but only a few reach the bottom to buy. Each stage—awareness, interest, desire, and action—helps turn shoppers into loyal customers. For Sephora, this means guiding beauty lovers from exploring makeup tips to checking out their favorite products.

Stage 1: Awareness

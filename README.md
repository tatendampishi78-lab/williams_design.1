## Team collaboration and deliverables

For teams of 2–3 students using your OWN team repository (do not commit to the instructor’s repo):
- Each student completes TWO pages total:
  1) ONE topic research page: choose exactly one of Archetype, Persuasion, or Sales Funnel and complete the template under `docs/`
  2) ONE competitor analysis page: copy `docs/competitors/competitor-template.md` and rename it for your competitor (for example, `docs/competitors/starbucks.md`)

Organize links to all student pages in this README so the instructor can find everything quickly. Example:

```
## Team Pages

### Student A (Name)
- Topic: Archetype — docs/archetype.md
- Competitor: Starbucks — docs/competitors/starbucks.md

### Student B (Name)
- Topic: Persuasion — docs/persuasion.md
- Competitor: Dunkin — docs/competitors/dunkin.md

### Student C (Name)
- Topic: Sales Funnel — docs/sales-funnel.md
- Competitor: Blue Bottle — docs/competitors/blue-bottle.md
```

Recommended workflow to minimize merge conflicts:
- Step 1 (repo owner): Create your OWN team repository and add the empty files everyone will need:
  - `docs/archetype.md`, `docs/persuasion.md`, `docs/sales-funnel.md`
  - One competitor file per teammate (e.g., `docs/competitors/student-a.md`, `docs/competitors/student-b.md`) or use actual competitor names if known
- Step 2: Push to GitHub.
- Step 3: Collaboration options:
  - Option A (simpler): Add teammates as collaborators to the same repo. Each student creates a branch and opens PRs in this repo.
  - Option B (more advanced): Each student forks the team repo. Work in your fork and open PRs back to the team repo.
- Step 4: Each student edits only their two assigned pages and opens a Pull Request.
- Step 5: After review, merge PRs to main and update the README “Team Pages” section with links to the final filenames.

Naming guidance for competitor files:
- Final naming: `docs/competitors/<brand-name>.md` (e.g., `docs/competitors/starbucks.md`)
- If the brand isn’t chosen yet: temporarily use `docs/competitors/<student-name>.md`, then rename when finalized and update the README link.

Submission:
- Submit your team GitHub repository URL on Canvas. Ensure this README links to all research and competitor pages for each teammate.

Definition of Done (check before submitting):
- [ ] Each student completed 2 pages (1 topic + 1 competitor)
- [ ] README has a “Team Pages” section with working links to every student’s two pages
- [ ] All PRs reviewed and merged to main
- [ ] Repo URL submitted on Canvas
